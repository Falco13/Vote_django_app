- User model with registration implemented. User registration, user account activation, login and logout are developed by Class-based views.
- When a user is registered, the user is prompted for a username, first_name, last_name, email and password. A prerequisite for registration is confirmation of mail. A one-time link to activate your account is sent to your email.
- Also implements login through social networks such as GitHub, Google and Instagram.
- Only registered users who have confirmed their email and users logged in through social networks can vote.
- Each user can only vote once per poll.
